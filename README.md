### Elevator Pitch

> Finding calendar events from structured web content
 
### How It Works

1. Events in your web content are marked up with [Microformats](http://microformats.org) or [Structured Data](http://schema.org).
2. You include the [ADDTOC.AL Parser JavaScript](https://addtoc.al/scripts/highlight.js) (`https://addtoc.al/scripts/highlight.js`) on your webpage
3. Any detected events are highlighted as a contextual buttonâ‚¬
4. Users can click events to download a calendar file for their preferred personal organiser
