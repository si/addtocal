# Add To Cal

## Elevator Pitch

> Finding calendar events from structured web content
 
## How It Works

1. Events in your web content are marked up with [Microformats](http://microformats.org) or [Structured Data](http://schema.org).
2. Include the [Add To Cal SDK](https://addtoc.al/scripts/highlight.js) (`https://addtoc.al/scripts/highlight.js`) on your site.
3. Any detected events are highlighted with a contextual button or separate component.
4. Users can choose to download events as calendar files for their preferred personal organiser.

## Get Started

Download the latest build from the [Add To Cal Github repository](https://github.com/si/addtocal) or install via NPM / Yarn.
